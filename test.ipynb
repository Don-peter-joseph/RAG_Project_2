They don’t have the freedom of fixing prices.\\n\\n\\n� To run an automobile company in Nagaland, it is a little difficult at present, since\\n\\n\\nthere are no qualified candidate or professional candidates in the field of\\n\\n\\nautomobile.\\n\\n\\n� Taxation are made by different departments like GST, CGST, SGST, Income tax,\\n\\n\\nKohima Municipal Council and Underground taxes. To run a business in\\n\\n\\nNagaland double taxes have to be paid.\\n\\n\\n� Bikes are directly imported from Chennai by road. For which the transportation\\n\\n\\ncharges are made directly from the bank through annual basis.\\n\\n\\n� It take a lot of time since it is transported through road and they sometimes failed\\n\\n\\nto satisfy their customer’s demand.\\n\\n\\n� Damages during transportation are claimed through the insurance companies.\\n\\n\\n� Most of Royal Enfield riders are from the age groups between 20- late 40s\\n\\n\\n� From the context of Nagaland, most of the customers are very economic and\\n\\n\\ndemanding. They have categories them in three different groups:\\n\\n\\na. Economic customers: They usually go for prices instead of checking out the\\n\\n\\nfeatures, benefits and quality. They are also very difficult to negotiate with.\\n\\n\\nb. Resourceful and genuine customers: they go for the benefits, features and\\n\\n\\ncomfortability. Before purchasing they do a thorough research on the brand\\n\\n\\nand they take time to purchase. Sometimes instead of the employees, they tend\\n\\n\\nto know more about the product, which makes them difficult to answer all\\n\\n\\ntheir questions.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n',\n",

      "Dear Public Water System Owners/Operators:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) is in the process of implementing a new aboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in its drinking water bacteriology testin aboratory. The OpenELIS (OE) LIMS will provide the laboratory with improved sample managemen capability, improved data integrity and reduced potential for human data entry error. In addition, the system will provide improved reporting capabilities, including direct electronic data exchange with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' (MDNR) Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS). SDWIS is the computer system MDNR uses to store regulatory water testing data and report testing results to you and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the new OE LIMS will provide a web portal that MSPHL clients can use to access their own test results in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the MSPHL implements this new computer system, several changes will be made in the way you collect and submit water samples for testing. This letter and information packet will provide you with information to help educate you on these changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## NEW SAMPLE BOTTLES:\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning in August 2015, the MSPHL began using a larger sample bottle for water bacterial testing. This bottle has a shrink wrap seal and two lines to indicate the proper sample volume. Please read the attached \"SAMPLE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS\" for details on how to use these new bottles. Sample volume MUST be within the two lines on the bottle (100 - 120 mL) to be acceptable for testing. You may continue to use your old bottles until the MSPHL can ship you new ones. Once you have received the new bottles, please discard or recycle the old bottles.\n",
      "\n",
      "## NEW SAMPLE INFORMATION FORMS:\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditional sample information \"card\" that has been used for more than twenty years is being replaced by the Environmental Sample Collection Form. An example form is attached. Please read the attached instructions for information on properly completing the new form.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Changes to the form include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The form is printed by the OE LIMS and will be pre-populated with your Public Water Supply ID number, PWS name, address and county. Forms should not be shared with other supplies.\n",
      "1. Form size is expanded to a single 8 ½\" x 11\" sheet of paper. The form is no longer in a triplicate carbon copy format. You may choose to photocopy for your records if you prefer. Note: MDNR does not require a public water system to retain copies of sample collection forms; however, you might utilize them for system inspections.\n",
      "\n",
      "www.health.mo.gov\n",
      "\n",
      "Healthy Missourians for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeremiao w. ay) Nixon\n",
      "\n",
      "- Contract operators will be provided with forms for all the supplies they operate. Blank forms will be available for MDNR Regional Office staff use.\n",
      "4. Facility ID, Sample Collection Point ID and Location for the sampling site MUST be provided by the collector. This information is available from your MDNR approved PWS sampling plan. MDNR will be providing all public water systems with a current copy of their approved sampling plan. This information is required by SDWIS and is used by MDNR to ensure regulatory compliance requirements have been met. Failure to complete this information on the sample collection form may result in a non-compliance report from MDNR\n",
      "3. The form requires all requested information to be printed by the collector. There are no longer check boxes for Sample Type or Repeat Location.\n",
      "5. A Collector Signature line has been added. The sample collector must sign the form to attest the information provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSPHL will begin shipping the new forms to public water systems in late November or early December. Please begin using the new forms December 16, 2015. Discard all the old forms (\"cards\") at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "## NEW SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample instructions have been revised to include changes to the bottle and sampling form. The instructions include detailed information on how to collect the sample using the new bottle, how to complete the new sample collection form, how to best ship samples to the MSPHL using the free MSPHL courier system, and how to register for the new MSPHL web portal. A copy of these instructions is attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "## NEW WEB PORTAL FOR RESULTS REPORTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The OE LIMS provides a web portal that may be used by systems to view and print their test result reports, check status of samples, download sample information into Excel, and receive automated emails when samples are received at the laboratory, and when sample results are ready to be viewed. For information on how to gain access to this portal, please contact Shondra Johnson, LIMS Administrator at Shondra.Johnson@health.mo.gov or at 573-751-3334.\n",
      "\n",
      "## IMPLEMENTATION DATES:\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSPHL intends to implement the OpenELIS LIMS on December 1, 2015. There will be a two week testing period in which laboratory staff will run the new LIMS in conjunction with our current manual, paper-based system to ensure the OE LIMS is operating properly. You may continue to submit samples as you currently do, using the old sample information card, throughout this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 16, 2015, the MSPHL plans to \"go-live\" with the new OE LIMS. Samples submitted after that date should be submitted on the new Environmental Sample Collection Form. At that time, the MSPHL Test Results Web Portal will also be available to those systems that have been granted access.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSPHL and MDNR understand that there will be a lot of changes to a system that has been in place for many years. The MSPHL is excited about the added benefits from this new system, and we ask for your patience as we implement the OpenELIS LIMS at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any questions, please contact the MSPHL Environmental Bacteriology Unit at 573-7513334. You may also contact your MDNR Regional Office for additional information on sample collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, thank you for your patience and understanding as we implement these changes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Assemble all of the sampling supplies. Before you begin, wash your hands thoroughly before handling supplies. Go to the sampling location(s) specified in your Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) approved sampling site plan. The sample should be taken from a clean, smooth-nosed cold water faucet if possible. Avoid drinking fountains, leaky faucets, hot/cold mixing faucets and frost-proof yard hydrants since it is not practical to sterilize these fixtures. If possible, remove any aerators, strainers or hoses that are present because they may harbor bacteria. Follow the procedures below when collecting the sample. Instructions for completing the environmental sampling form are on the following page.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Open the cold water tap for about 3 minutes before collecting the sample. This should adequately flush the water line of any debris.\n",
      "3. Flush the tap for an additional 3 minutes with cold water, and then reduce to a gentle flow to about the width of a pencil. Do not change the water flow once you have started sampling as this could dislodge contaminants in the tap.\n",
      "2. Flame-sterilize the tap and/or chemically disinfect the tap. Do not flamesterilize if tap is plastic or if aerators are attached. Disinfect tap by thoroughly rinsing both the inside and outside of the tap with a mixture of 50% house-hold bleach (NaOCI) and 50% tap water. Take extreme care with strong bleach (oxidizing) solutions.\n",
      "4. Remove the plastic shrink wrap seal by pulling down on the red strip and pealing the shrink wrap from both the cap and bottle. Discard the shrink wrap. Do not attempt to reseal the lid with shrink wrap still attached.\n",
      "5. Grasp cap along top edge and remove carefully. Do not touch the inside with your fingers. Hold the bottle in one hand and the cap in the other. Do not lay the cap down or put it in a pocket! Also, take care not to contaminate the sterile bottle or cap with your fingers or permit the faucet to touch the inside of the bottle.\n",
      "6. Hold the bottle so that water entering the bottle will not come in contact with your hands or the outside of the bottle.\n",
      "8. Fill out the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) State Public Health Lab (SPHL) Environmental Sample Collection Form using waterproof ink. See attached document for instructions on properly completing the sample collection form and for shipping instructions.\n",
      "7. Fill the bottle until the water sample level is BETWEEN THE TWO LINES on the bottle (100 - 120 ml). Preferably, the sample level should be at or just slightly above the 100 ml line. Sample levels below the 100 ml (lower) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to insufficient sample volume. Sample levels above the 120 ml (upper) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to overfilled bottle. If the bottle is overfilled, you may pour off any excess water to get the sample level between the two lines. Place the cap on the bottle and screw it down tightly.\n",
      "9. For single samples, neatly fold the sample collection form into thirds (standard letter fold), roll around the bottle and place in the shipping box. For multiple samples, fold the forms once or more as needed, and place in the shipping box alongside the samples. If needed, use bubble pack or folded paper to fill space. Do not use shredded paper. Seal the box with a single strip of shipping tape and affix the return address label to the top of the box.\n",

      "Per U.S. Environmental Protection Ageney requirements, public water samples must be received by the laboratory and tested within 30 hours of the date and time of collection. The MSPHL and MDNR recommend you use the free Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) contract courier for overnight delivery to the MSPHL. This courier picks up at most local public health agency offices and hospitals (Note: Not all hospitals will accept water samples for courier pick up). For sample drop off locations and times, please go to http://www.health.mo.gov/lab/courierservices.php and click on the interactive map or the listing of drop off locations by county; or you may call the MSPHL courier liaison at (573) 751-4830, or the MDNR Public Drinking Water Branch (PDWB) at (573) 526-1124.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note the courier is allowed to pick up samples within one hour of the scheduled time (before or after). The earliest pick up time is at 10:30 a.m. To ensure your samples meet the transit time requirement of 30 hours, it is important that you collect your samples in the morning and have them dropped off at the courier pickup point one hour prior to the scheduled time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use of the U.S. Postal Service or other commercial carriers such as Fed Ex or UPS will require additional charges and may not meet the 30 hour transit time requirement.\n",
